<h1>"Big smile, little guy, big eyes." </h1>

<p>A moment shared in passing by St. Francis de Sales Highschool president, Fr. Geoff Rose, describing student Marvelous Walten who fell victim to gun violence in 2021 (Kirby), my sophomore year of highschool. He was number 9 on our football field, but 1 of 2,266 shooting victims in the city of Toledo, OH that year–a record high from 2020 to 2024.</p>

<h1>Crime in Toledo, excluding shootings and homicides, decreased in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period the year prior.
</h1>

<p> The persons shot category showed an increase from 2023 to 2024, but the number would’ve shown a decrease had self-inflicted shootings not been included. The latest Toledo Police Department–TPD–mid-year crime report reveals a more accurate picture for the city, as 2023 marked the first decline in violent crime following backlogs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
    <p> TPD Chief Michael Troendle attributes the increase in homicides during the first half of 2024 to several double homicides and two incidents involving the death of TPD officers and a suspect. He claims the department’s youth curfew enforcement efforts decreased the amount of youth violence in the city.
