      <p1>A moment shared in passing by St. Francis de Sales Highschool president, Fr. Geoff Rose, describing student Marvelous Walten, who fell victim to gun violence in 2021, my sophomore year of high school. He was number nine on our football field, but 1 of 2,266 shooting victims in the city of Toledo, OH, that year-a record high from 2020 to 2024.

The latest Toledo Police Department (TPD) mid-year crime report reveals a more accurate picture for the city, as 2023 marked the first decline in violent crime following backlogs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz says "...we are not satisfied with where we are, and we won't be satisfied until these numbers continue to go down. But this is a story of progress and it's a good and encouraging story." TPD Chief Michael Troendle attributes the increase in homicides during the first half of 2024 to several double homicides and two incidents involving the death of TPD officers and a suspect. He claims the department's youth curfew enforcement efforts decreased the amount of youth violence in the city.

<p1> Leading the list of total reported crimes is theft from motor vehicles, accounting for 17.47% of all offenses, followed closely by aggravated assault (16.7%) and aggravated burglary involving occupied residences (15.8%). Auto theft accounts for 14.94% of crimes with other notable categories including robbery with a weapon (6.58%), truck and bus theft (6.4%), and unoccupied burglary or breaking and entering (6.51%). While less frequent, offenses such as home invasion robbery (0.09%) show that targeted crimes account for less than opportunistic crimes, highlighting the need for preventive measures to secure easily accessible property. Anthony Wayne High School resource officer Morgan Schumann tells me that any "student loss is a reminder of the real lives behind a statistic. Each shooting leaves a family and a community shattered. It's clear that we need more than just numbers to change-what we need is safer spaces for our youth to grow and opportunities to distract them from bad alternatives." When broken down by location, there are notable geographic disparities in crime, with West Toledo leading the city at 503 reported incidents, followed closely by East Toledo's 484 and South Toledo's 442. Central areas near the University of Toledo (414) and Downtown Toledo (406) also saw elevated crime counts. In contrast, suburban areas like Maumee and Holland reported minimal activity, with just seven and one incident, respectively. These patterns emphasize the concentration of criminal activity in urban neighborhoods and underscore the need for targeted safety initiatives in Toledo's hardest-hit areas.

<h3>Toledo unveiled a 5-year gun violence reduction plan on August 15th, with hopes of putting "Peace in Motion."</h3>

</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p1>In response to the concerning trends outlined in Toledo's 2024 Mid-Year Crime Report, city officials unveiled the "Peace in Motion" plan, a five-year initiative to reduce gun violence and improve community safety. Malcolm Cunningham, the city's director of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, emphasized the need for systemic changes to address violence at its roots. "We want a reduction in violence, an increase in opportunity, and an improvement in neighborhoods," Cunningham told WTOL 11, highlighting the plan's focus on community engagement and resource coordination. Cunningham, who also leads the Save Our Community initiative, acknowledged the limitations of government programs alone saying "Save Our Community is not enough. It needs to be a community-wide effort, supported by better coordination and timely access to resources."

  <p1>The report's data shows theft from motor vehicles (17.47%), aggravated assault (16.7%), and aggravated burglary (15.8%) are among the most prevalent crimes. Coupled with significant geographic disparities—such as the high incident counts in West Toledo and East Toledo—the findings emphasize the urgency of addressing both systemic and geographical socioeconomic inequality. Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz endorsed the plan, calling it a blend of short-term actions and long-term investments. "While we're adding police officers and creating opportunities for youth, we're also making long-term commitments to public health and safety" he said. The plan includes hospital-based violence intervention programs and potential compensation for families impacted by shootings.</p1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p1>Cunningham emphasized the economic argument for prevention, noting the city currently spends $570,000 every time someone is shot and $880,000 for a fatal shooting. Redirecting these resources toward prevention could yield significant savings while improving public safety.
  </p1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p1>Although initiatives are being implemented to address the issue, Toledo still has a long way to go in ensuring that no more young lives are lost to senseless violence, so that the community can begin to heal one family at a time.
