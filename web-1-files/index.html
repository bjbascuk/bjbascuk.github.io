<h1> "Why did Democrats win Senate races in so many states Trump won? Ticket splitters"</h1>

<h2>WASHINGTON – Duane Canther, a 66-year-old union member who builds parts for car companies in Michigan, voted for Republican President-elect Donald Trump, but he supported Joseph Solis-Mullen, the Libertarian candidate in Michigan's narrowly decided Senate race. Votes like his are part of why Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin defeated former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers to fill an open seat left by the retirement of Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., by 0.4 percentage points, even though Trump won the state by 1.4 points.</h2>

<p>“I voted just to say I voted for somebody. They say if you don’t vote you can’t complain,” Canther said about his Senate vote.</p>

<p>“I felt both of them were flipping back and forth on certain things," he added, referring to the Democratic and Republican Senate nominees.</p>

<p>Neighboring Wisconsin took a similar path, re-electing Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin over Republican challenger Eric Hovde, even while giving its 10 Electoral College votes to Trump.</p>

<p>"Ticket-splitting" voters helped Trump carry Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina − where Trump prevailed while Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein won the governor's race. Trump also won Nevada, where Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen beat her GOP opponent Sam Brown. And he is on track to win Arizona, which has not yet been called, where Democratic Rep. Reuben Gallego is leading Republican candidate Kari Lake.</p>

<p>There were important exceptions. Republicans beat incumbent Democratic Sens. Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, though all three performed better in their state than Vice President Kamala Harris did.</p>

<p>Ticket-splitting used to be common, and while it is becoming less so in an era of increased partisanship, the swing-state down-ballot results show split tickets still can determine the outcome of key races.</p>

<p>“There are still differences between presidential and Senate races,” Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said. “And those differences broke in Democrats’ favor across these states.”</p>

<h3>Running away from Joe Biden</h3>

<p>The Democrats that prevailed in the presidential swing states worked to distinguish themselves from President Joe Biden, whose favorability ratings have been underwater for years, and campaigned on an independent brand tailored to their states.</p>

<p>In Arizona, for example, Gallego did not shy away from challenges facing border communities and emphasized the need to secure the southern border, a top issue in the southwestern state. Rosen in Nevada touted her bipartisan work to improve the state’s infrastructure. Baldwin in Wisconsin emphasized her dedication to policies supporting farmers and rural residents, and Slotkin in Michigan noted her commitment to American manufacturing.</p>

<p>Experts disagree on how split ticket voters are distributing their choices. Some say most split-ticket voters that supported Trump are handing Democrats the downballot victory by only voting for president, or voting third party for lower office, like Borden and Canther. Others say downballot Democrats won Trump supporters’ vote by distinguishing themselves from the national Democratic Party.</p>

<p>“The Senate candidates are often well known to voters” because they run intense campaigns with a flood of advertisements, said Barry Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

<p>And because turnout was similar for the presidential and the Senate races in most states, he argued, it is likely that some people are still splitting their ticket between the two parties.</p>

<p>“So voters in some places are making real distinctions to say this is not somebody who is aligned with Trump or represents him in the same way, or this is someone who has the state’s interest in mind in a way that other candidates don’t,” he said. “And that really is a different story from one state to the next.”</p>
